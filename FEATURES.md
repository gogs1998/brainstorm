Based on typical usage patterns:

**Light User** (5 conversations/week, 2 models):
- ~20,000 tokens/week
- ~$0.30-0.50/week
- ~$15-20/month

**Regular User** (3 conversations/day, 2-3 models):
- ~100,000 tokens/week
- ~$1.50-2.50/week
- ~$50-80/month

**Power User** (10+ conversations/day, 3 models):

**Tips to reduce costs:**
- Use 2 models instead of 3
