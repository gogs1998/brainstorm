→ Models discuss React's codebase in detail
```

**Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Code:** Complete implementation in ENHANCEMENTS.md

### 4. **Historical Figures Mode** ✅ SUPER FUN!
Already detailed in **ENHANCEMENTS.md**

**The Vision:**
- Einstein & Shakespeare discuss time

- Cleopatra & Eleanor Roosevelt on power
- Da Vinci & Tesla geek out

**15 figures included:**
- 👨‍🔬 Einstein
- 🎭 Shakespeare
- 👑 Cleopatra

**Time:** 4-6 hours  
**Code:** Complete personality prompts in ENHANCEMENTS.md

### 5. **Text-to-Speech** ✅ NEW REQUEST
Already detailed in **PRIORITY-FEATURES.md**

**Why it's amazing:**
- Historical figures NEED voices to feel real
- Listen while driving/walking/cooking
- Accessibility
- Mobile-friendly
- Hands-free brainstorming

**Implementation:**
- OpenAI TTS: $0.015 per 1K chars
- Different voice for each model/figure
- Auto-play option
- Speed control

**Voice examples:**
- Einstein: Deep, thoughtful (onyx)
- Elvis: Warm, smooth (shimmer)
- Shakespeare: Theatrical (nova)
- Claude: Clear, professional (alloy)

**Time:** 2-3 weeks  
**Code:** Complete implementation in PRIORITY-FEATURES.md

---

### 6. **Code Execution** ✅ NEW REQUEST
Already detailed in **PRIORITY-FEATURES.md**

**Why it's critical:**
- Run code directly in chat
- Models see actual output
- Iterate until it works
- No switching to IDE
- GAME CHANGER for developers

**How it works:**
```
Claude: "Here's a Python script for fibonacci"
[Shows code block]
You: [Click "▶ Run"]
→ Output appears inline
→ Models can iterate based on results
```

**Languages:**
1. Python (priority)
2. JavaScript/TypeScript
3. Go, Rust, Java, etc.

**Options:**
- E2B (easiest): $0.02 per execution
- Judge0: $0.01 per execution
- Self-hosted Docker (free but complex)

**Time:** 6-8 weeks  
**Code:** Complete implementation in PRIORITY-FEATURES.md

---

### 7. **iOS App** ✅ NEW REQUEST
Already detailed in **PRIORITY-FEATURES.md**

**Strategy:**
1. **Start with PWA** (1-2 weeks)
   - Add to home screen
   - Works offline
   - Test mobile demand
   
2. **Then Native iOS** (12-16 weeks)
   - Full App Store presence
   - Siri integration
   - Widgets
   - Push notifications
   - Apple Watch support

**Features:**
- Voice-first input
- Swipe gestures
- Offline mode
- iCloud sync
- Background audio

**Cost:**
- PWA: Minimal (1-2 weeks)
- Native: $24K-72K (hire dev) OR 5-8 months (DIY)

## 💡 Special Notes

### **Historical Figures - Integrated or Standalone?**

**I strongly recommend: Integrated**

**Reasons:**
1. ✅ Share all features (reactions, search, export, TTS!)
2. ✅ Can mix modes (Einstein + Claude is awesome)
3. ✅ One codebase to maintain
4. ✅ Easy to extract later if needed

**How it works:**
- Add a mode toggle
- When "Historical" selected, show figure selector instead of model selector
- Everything else stays the same!

**Implementation:** Just follow ENHANCEMENTS.md

---

### **TTS + Historical Figures = Magic ✨**

Imagine:
- Einstein explaining relativity **in his voice**
- Shakespeare performing a sonnet **theatrically**
- Elvis discussing music **with Southern charm**
- Stalin reviewing movies **in deep, serious tone**

This is where TTS + Historical Figures = **INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE**

Do these together!
